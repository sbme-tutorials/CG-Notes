## Ray Casting

--


### Vision Process

Vision process is as follow
--

![](../../images/cameragen.gif)



---
## Ray Casting Cont, 

--
**Ideally**

* There is an infinite number of rays 
* Multiple reflections happen for the same ray on different objects 
--


* So how we simulate this in computer graphics ?
Keep in mind that the objective is to get a 2D image of the scene. 


---

## Ray Casting Cont, 
--

**Basic Idea**
The process is reversed where rays are sent from the camera position instead of receive it at the camera position. 
--


Pseudo code for ray casting  
```python 
for each pixel:
    Send a ray through the scene
    Find the interection with objects 
    Calculate the color at this intersection 
    Assign this color to that pixel where ray was sent from
```

## Ray Tracing

--

![](../../images/ray-tracing.png)
--


* It is the same idea with more complex calculations
--


* Rays must be checked with all objects in the scene by tracking its reflections recursively. 
--


* It is computationally extensive and time-consuming process but has realistic results.

---
## Ray Tracing Cont, 
--

* Sample of generated images with ray tracing [(source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics))

### Ray Tracing Cont,

Another sample. Look how realistic it is.

## Lighting and materials 

### Classical lighting model 
--


* Ambient lighting : 

	It is an approximation of environmental light that comes from all direction and there is no direct light source. This light bounces through the scene equally. As a result, it illuminate all objects equally. It's like a fading light. 
--


* Diffuse lighting

	The light that comes from a specific light source and reflected in all direction due to the roughness of the surface. 
--




---
## Lighting Cont, 

--

![](../../images/diffuse.png)

Reflection is in all direction.
---
## Lighting Cont, 

--

* Specular lighting:

	This light comes from a particular direction and perfectly reflect on the surface. Such effect is clear for the smooth surfaces.
--

![](../../images/specular.png)

---
##  Lighting Cont,

--
* This is the effect of each component
--

---
## Lighting in OpenGL 

--
* First, we need to define the light properties by defining RGB color for the ambient, diffuse, and specular components. 

```c
// Here we have a white light source
float light_ambient[] = {1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0};
float light_diffuse[] = {1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0};
float light_specular[] = {1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0};
```

--


We need also to define the position of thr light source in our scene.

```c
// This is the light position
float light_position[] = {0.0, 0.0, 4.0, 1.0};
```


---
## Lighting in OpenGL Cont,

--

* Second, Specify and assign the light properties including the position to a specific light source.

```c
// Setting light source properties and enabling it
glLightfv(GL_LIGHT1, GL_POSITION, light_position);
glLightfv(GL_LIGHT1, GL_AMBIENT, light_ambient);
glLightfv(GL_LIGHT1, GL_DIFFUSE, light_diffuse);
glLightfv(GL_LIGHT1, GL_SPECULAR, light_specular);

```
--



* Finally, We need to enable that light source and enable lighting in general. 

```c
glEnable(GL_LIGHT1);
glEnable(GL_LIGHTING);
```

---
## Defining material properties 

--
* We've seen how to create light sources and assign specific ambient, diffuse, and specular properties. 

--

* We also need to define the properties of the objects in the scene in terms of ambient, diffuse, specular, emission, and shines.
--

* First define the object properties. 

```c
GLfloat material_ambient[] = {0.1, 0.01, 0.01, 1.0},
        material_diffuse[] = {0.3, 0.01, 0.01, 1.0},
        material_specular[] = {1, 0.01, 0.01, 1.0},
        material_shininess = 30;

```
--

* Second, assign it to the object material

```c
glMaterialfv(GL_FRONT, GL_AMBIENT, material_ambient);
glMaterialfv(GL_FRONT, GL_DIFFUSE, material_diffuse);
glMaterialfv(GL_FRONT, GL_SPECULAR, material_specular);
glMaterialf(GL_FRONT, GL_SHININESS, material_shininess);
```

## Red light sphere Demo

This is an example of a solid sphere 
--


**No light sources**

![](../../images/no-light.png)
---
## Red light sphere Demo Cont,

--


**Only ambient is set**


![](../../images/amb.png)
---
## Red light sphere Demo Cont,


--


**Ambient and diffuse**


![](../../images/diff.png)
---
## Red light sphere Demo Cont,


--


**Ambient, diffuse, and specular**


![](../../images/spec.png)
--


**Note**

The overall appearance of the object is determined by both  material and light properties (**lightlab Demo**) 
---
### Shading models

--

--


There are two types of shading:
--


* Flat shading where each facet is shaded with its color and in between edges will appear. This is due to the color differences between facets. 

```c
glShadeModel(GL_FLAT);
```
--


* Gouraud shading (Smooth) where the color of the in between edges is an interpolation of the color of the surrounding facets. As a result, no clear edges are seen. It looks smooth.
```c
glShadeModel(GL_SMOOTH);
```
--


By default it's shading is smooth.
