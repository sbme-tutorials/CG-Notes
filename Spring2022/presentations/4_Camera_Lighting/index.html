## Types of Transformations

--


*  Modelling transformation:
	* Size, place, scale, and rotate objects parts
	* Object coordinates to **World coordinates**
--


* Viewing transforms:
	* Rotate & translate the world to lie directly in front of the camera
	* World coordinates to **camera or view coordinates**
--


* Projection transforms:
	* View coordinate to **screen coordinates** (Pixels)

---
## Camera Movement

--

* Previously we learned how we create and locate the camera using
--


```c++
void gluLookAt(	GLdouble eyeX,
 	GLdouble eyeY,
 	GLdouble eyeZ,
 	GLdouble centerX,
 	GLdouble centerY,
 	GLdouble centerZ,
 	GLdouble upX,
 	GLdouble upY,
 	GLdouble upZ);
```
--

* where the camera is located at eye , look at center , and keep orientation with up vector.

--

* Now we want to move the camera around the scene 
--


* By moving the camera a transformation must be applied to all scene. 
---

## Camera coordinates 
--

We need to create a coordinate frame by the camera where
--


* The look vector is **center minus eye**
--


* Then use cross product with up vector
--

---
## Types of Camera Movements

--

* Rotating the Camera around the vertical direction of the window 
--


* Rotating the Camera around the horizontal direction of the window 
--


* Moving forward and backward to navigate the scene. 

---
## Rotation around Vertical Direction

--

* Vertical of the window of course is parallel to the Up vector
--


* What we need to do is to rotate the eye around the Up vector
--

Steps: 

 1. Rotate the eye position about the up vector 
 2. The up vector and the center point remain fixed. 
--


* Rotation matrix around arbitrary vector $$R(a, \theta) = $$

$$
cos\theta \begin{pmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 \\\
0 & 1 & 0 \\\
0 & 0 & 1 
\end{pmatrix} + (1-cos\theta) \begin{pmatrix}
x^2 & xy & z^2 \\\ 
xy & y^2 & yz \\\
xz & yz & z^2
\end{pmatrix} + sin\theta \begin{pmatrix}
0 & -z & y \\\
z &  0 & -x \\\
-y & x & 0 
\end{pmatrix} 
$$
---
### Implementation

--

```c++
void rotatePoint(double a[], double theta, double p[])
{

	double temp[3];
	temp[0] = p[0];
	temp[1] = p[1];
	temp[2] = p[2];

	temp[0] = -a[2] * p[1] + a[1] * p[2];
	temp[1] = a[2] * p[0] - a[0] * p[2];
	temp[2] = -a[1] * p[0] + a[0] * p[1];

	temp[0] *= sin(theta);
	temp[1] *= sin(theta);
	temp[2] *= sin(theta);

	temp[0] += (1 - cos(theta))*(a[0] * a[0] * p[0] + a[0] * a[1] * p[1] + a[0] * a[2] * p[2]);
	temp[1] += (1 - cos(theta))*(a[0] * a[1] * p[0] + a[1] * a[1] * p[1] + a[1] * a[2] * p[2]);
	temp[2] += (1 - cos(theta))*(a[0] * a[2] * p[0] + a[1] * a[2] * p[1] + a[2] * a[2] * p[2]);

	temp[0] += cos(theta)*p[0];
	temp[1] += cos(theta)*p[1];
	temp[2] += cos(theta)*p[2];

	p[0] = temp[0];
	p[1] = temp[1];
	p[2] = temp[2];

}
```
---
## Rotation around Horizontal Direction

Steps: 
--


1. Compute the current horizontal direction from the up vector and the look vector.
--


2. Rotate the eye about the horizontal direction.
--


3. Rotate the up vector about the horizontal direction.


---
### Horizontal Direction 

--
* Get the look vector (center - eye) and normalize it. 
--


* Apply Cross product between the up and look vectors
--



```c++
void crossProduct(double a[], double b[], double c[])
{
	c[0] = a[1] * b[2] - a[2] * b[1];
	c[1] = a[2] * b[0] - a[0] * b[2];
	c[2] = a[0] * b[1] - a[1] * b[0];
}
```
--


* Normalize the horizontal direction
--


```c++

void normalize(double a[])
{
	double norm;
	norm = a[0] * a[0] + a[1] * a[1] + a[2] * a[2];
	norm = sqrt(norm);
	a[0] /= norm;
	a[1] /= norm;
	a[2] /= norm;
}
```
--


* Rotate the eye and the up around that vector.

---
## Moving forward and backward with the camera

--

* Obviously when we move forward we move from our location towards the target in front of our sight.
--


* Obviously when we move forward we move from our location towards the target in front of our sight.

```c++
	direction[0] = center[0] - eye[0];
	direction[1] = center[1] - eye[1];
	direction[2] = center[2] - eye[2];
```
--

* Then we update eye and center location by multiplying the speed of movement by the direction computed above.

```c++
	eye[0]    += direction[0] * speed;
	eye[1]    += direction[1] * speed;
	eye[2]    += direction[2] * speed;

	center[0] += direction[0] * speed;
	center[1] += direction[1] * speed;
	center[2] += direction[2] * speed;
```
--

**HINT:** up vector remain the same in forward and backward movement.
--


**Question** what is the different between forward and backward movements ?

---
##  OpenGL Double Buffering

--
* Double buffer is a technique for tricking the eye into seeing smooth animation of rendered scenes.
--


* It consists of:
--

    1. Front buffer used for current scene display 
--

    2. Back buffer used by the application to process the next scene without interrupting the current one
--


* We swap the buffer after each display to view the rendered new scene.
--


* To enable Double buffering:

```c++
 glutInitDisplayMode( GLUT_RGB | GLUT_DOUBLE );
```
---
### Double Buffering Cont, 

--
You must clear the back buffer rendering so you include the following line at first to your display function:

```c++
glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT );
```
--


* At the end of the display function we swap the buffers to show rendered frame.  

```c++
glutSwapBuffers();
```

---
## OpenGL Depth Buffering

--

* Depth buffering is a technique to determine which primitives in your scene are occluded by other primitives when mapping from the world coordinates to the screen coordinates (projection).
--


* Each pixel in a primitive is rasterized, its distance from the eye point of the camera **(depth value)** and compared with the values stored in the depth buffer. 
--


* If the pixel depth is less than the one stored from previous display in the depth buffer its depth is stored in the depth buffer instead of it. 
--


* The color value of the pixel in the depth buffer is written in the color buffer.
--


* to enable depth buffering with double buffering
--


```c++
glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_RGB | GLUT_DOUBLE| GLUT_DEPTH );
```
---
### Depth Buffering Cont, 

--
Optionally in your display function test the depth buffer

```c++
glEnable( GL_DEPTH_TEST );
```
--


and clear both color and depth buffer after each frame.

```c++
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT );
```
