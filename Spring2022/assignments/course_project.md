3. Join your group.

## Part 1: Programming

* Build volume rendering web app with VTK.js & HTML
* Use datasets provided in vtk examples (head for surface rendering and chest for
ray casting)
    * **Bonus:** Loading volumes dynamically using load button

* Features
   
    * Surface rendering with adjustable iso value (try sliders)
    * Ray casting rendering (with a fixed transfer function)

## Part 2: Written

Report all details about your implementations in markdown file (Report.md). Report must show sample results of your code. Organize the report and be concise. State issues you faced in the assignment and how you treated with it. Mention any kind of contribution of other students.

## Grading:
Your grade will be determined as
follows:

1. **50%** on a correctly running app visualizing a 3D volume 
2. **10%** on supporting surface rendering with adjustable iso value
3. **10%** on supporting ray casting volume rendering with fixed transfer function
3. **10%** on correctly adding the cropping widget 
5. **10%** on follow up with the TA 
6. **10%** on the presentation and answering submission questions


## Late Policy:
Assignments received after due date will be marked down 10%, and 5% more per day that
