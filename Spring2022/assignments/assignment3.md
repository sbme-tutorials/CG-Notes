title:  "Assignment 3: Texture mapping and Loading objects"
---

## Objectives
 
* Texture mapping
* Loading external objects.
* Lighting and coloring.
* Animation and interaction


## Deadline

Deadline for online submission will be on **Thursday 16/5/2022 11:59 PM**

## Joining to Assignment Repository

1. Go to the [Assignment Page]().
2. Accept the assignment.
3. Join your group.

## Part 1: Programming

Previously you designed the robotic body with a full of movements.

1. Draw a floor and put the full body on top of it.

2. Put a texture on the floor.

3. Use a menu binned to the right mouse button to change the floor texture.

4. You are required to to design two animations:
    * One using the robotic body without interaction with any object.
    * Another animation: the robotic body should interact with one of the loaded objects

5. Download different objects and load it in your scene to make sense of the animation environment.

## Part 2: Written

Report all details about your implementations in markdown file (Report.md). Report must show sample results of your code. Organize the report and be concise. State issues you faced in the assignment and how you treated with it. Mention any kind of contribution of other students.

## Important Notes 

* Each team should design unique animations than other teams.
* All images used in texture mapping in the provided code should be .bmp format.
* **You should neither use the provided texture not the provided object in class tutorial**.

## Grading:
Most of your grade will be based on what is seen on the screen, actions taken when the keys
are pressed, and your implementation, i.e. your code. Your grade will be determined as
follows:
1. **60%** on correctly adding texture and loading objects in the scene.
2. **10%** on adding lighting and changing texture using mouse menu
3. **10%** on the animation of the objects. 
5. **10%** on the report 
6. **10%** on answering submission questions.

## Deliverables:
1. The cpp files only.
2. The  Report.md file.

## Late Policy:
Assignments received after due date will be marked down 10%, and 5% more per day that
assignment is late. After a week no assignments will be accepted.
